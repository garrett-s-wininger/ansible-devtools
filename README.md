# Ansible Collection - garrett_s_wininger.devtools

This collection is a personal setup that I use in order to configure new or 
existing systems to prepare for writing code in a number of programming 
languages, development environments, and build systems. The basic playbook 
contained within uses roles with matching tags to allow specifying which 
tooling should be installed on a case-by-case basis. Since this approach is 
extremely granular, it is expected to be used on a one-off basis whereas 
more complex setups, such as full-stack development, may include their own 
roles or playbooks for ease-of-use.
